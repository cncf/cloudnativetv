## Maturity Levels
CloudNative.TV shows have a maturity level of sandbox, incubating, or graduated, which corresponds to the Innovators, Early Adopters, and Early Majority tiers of the Crossing the Chasm diagram. The maturity level is a signal by CNCF as to how popular the show is. Shows increase their maturity by demonstrating their sustainability to the Program Committee: that they have an audience, a healthy cadence of shows, have engaged viewers who interact with the stream, and can drive new subscribers and viewers.

Sandbox - Experiment stage to try out new shows

Incubation - Growing in audience and has its core folks chatting in channel

Graduated - large and engaged audience delivering new content weekly
