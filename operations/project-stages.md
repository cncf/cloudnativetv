# Project stages

- Bootstrap
- Sandbox
- Incubating
- Graduated

### Bootstrap

During bootstrap, all shows must:

- Stream once every 2 weeks on CTV

In the case that a Showrunner is unable to hold their show at the scheduled time, they should inform the Leadership Committee (Co-Chairs and CNCF Liason) with as much advance notice as possible so that other shows can be scheduled or assistance can be provided, as needed. If a Showrunner misses 3 or more shows out of the previous 5 scheduled air dates without notice or extenuating circumstances, the committee may remove the show from the schedule and replace it with another program, to ensure schedule continuity for the community.

### Sandbox

All shows that wish to be hosted under CTV at the sandbox level must:

- Stream once every 12 weeks on CTV

Sandbox shows can:

- Stream once every 4 weeks on CTV

Sandbox proposals will be reviewed by CTV for:

- Uniqueness
  - We don't want 4 shows using the same concept
  - Shows streamed in additional languages will be accepted
- Diversity
  - Demographic
  - Language

### Incubation

All shows that wish to be hosted under CTV at the incubation level must:

- Stream once every 4 weeks on CTV

Incubated shows can:

- Stream once every 2 weeks on CTV
