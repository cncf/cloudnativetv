# Show Guide

- Showrunner is responsible for all content/guests
- PG-13
- 30-60 Minute Slots
- Callouts at beginning and end of show, e.g., "Make sure to follow CloudNative.tv on Twitch and enable notifications to be reminded when we're live!"

**Twitch Operations Guidelines**

- Stream keys (and key rotation)
- Moderator tools
  - A lot of the &quot;busywork&quot; of moderation will be handled for you by Nightbot. This will handle automatic removal of comments containing slurs/banned profanity, spam, etc and timing out of the offending user. Nightbot is also capable of custom commands (e.g., typing !promo in chat will result in Nightbot replying with a link to register for KubeCon). Over time, we will add and document more commands.
  - Moderators have additional controls available natively in Twitch. From Twitch Chat Settings, toggle &quot;Show Moderation Actions&quot; to On and you will see three icons next to every user in chat: ban, timeout, and delete.
  - Banning someone from the channel does not prevent them from watching the content; it only bans them from the chat.
- Creator tools
- Contacts
  - If you have a catastrophic failure before/during your stream that you are unable to resolve, first try getting a hold of one of the following people for help:
    - Bill Mulligan
    - Kat Cosgrove
    - Pop

**OBS/Local Stream Software**

- OBS
  - Streamlabs OBS is the most well-supported and full-featured option for live streaming to Twitch. On Windows, this is fairly painless and the process is documented [here](https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/getting-started-with-streamlabs-obs).
  - On MacOS or Ubuntu, you will need to use vanilla OBS. Note that OBS is fairly resource-hungry, so if you are choosing between multiple machines to stream from, choose the beefier one for running OBS. You can get OBS [here](https://obsproject.com/)
  - Either way, you will need to set up your stream overlay. On Streamlabs, this will largely be a one-click deploy. On OBS, it will be more manual but it&#39;s a well-documented process and someone from CloudNative.tv will be available to help if you run into trouble. In both cases, you will need to modify it with your specific show&#39;s logo.
- Restream Studio
- Streamyard
  - Streamyard is browser based streaming platform with which you can stream to Youtube, twitch etc.
