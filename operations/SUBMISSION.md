# Show Selection and Submission

This document outlines the show submission requirements and selection process. It is currently a work in progress.

## Submission Process

Name:

Description:

Elevator Pitch:

Why do people join? How is it interactive?

Show Type: 101? Learning, Live Coding, Talk? Interview? Tech reviews?

Creative/Look/Logo requirements: 

Every show submission should ensure they can articulate their show clearly and concisely. What's the benefit to the audience? Can they explain it in a sentence?

## Questions new proposals should answer:

- Who is going to host the show?

- What previous experience/interactions does the host have engaging community members?

- Are they prepared to put on weekly/biweekly content?

**Additional Requirements**

Community engagement

- Having shown consistent interaction with the CNCF community

- Produced content

Quality of the proposal

- Unique: The proposal may build on a previous show but does not duplicate content

- Diverse: The proposal includes a plan on ways the show will encourage diversity within the community

- Technical niche:

- Relevance to the Community: Is this something the community actually wants, or something WE just think sounds cool? Who is the target audience?

Previous work

- Having done similar shows, this may relate to podcasts, youtube videos, streaming, panel discussions

- Previous work has an interactive aspect to it (giving a presentation is quite a different scenario than providing a discussion, live, with little to no preparation)

Additionally

- Providing support within the community

- Having shown initiative in creating opportunities and projects for the community

Proposals are evaluated on an ongoing basis. They are judged on many criteria, including (but not confined to) the quality of the proposal or completed work, the showrunners ptch , and the needs of the schedule. All projects for consideration will fall within the process that is described below. Projects that are unique and timely in nature will receive immediate attention, but CloudNative.tv WG/Committee will determine, in its sole discretion, which programs and proposals fall into this category.
