# 100 Days in Cloud Native

## Description: 
Join Anais as she journeys through the CNCF Landscape. We will provide you with a beginner's view of each project, including their use cases and advantages. Every show will guide you through the technology of a different project and ways to get started with those.
Why do people join?  How is it interactive?You can learn anything -- being given the right approach. This show will not only provide a snapshot of the tech but show how a complete newbie may approach different projects, including the resources that are available and how to make the best out of those. At the end of every show, we want to gain a clear understanding of the project and its use. This show is both for those building the projects, as well as anyone, who wants to get started.
