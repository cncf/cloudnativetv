<h2 align="center"> Description</h2>

There are lots of folks that bring creative elements to their work.
And there are more ways to contribute to the tech community than just through code.
Our mission is to give the humans of tech a way to share their art, their hobby, or their craft.
We believe that art and code belong together; that the diverse communities of tech are filled with highly
creative and amazing people that can contribute much more than code.
