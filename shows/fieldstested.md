# Fields Tested
## Description
Show Goals:
Make viewers feel comfortable getting hands-on with CNCF technologies.
Give viewers a starting point around ideas for use cases where CNCF technologies can be helpful.
The whole thing is a little “Mythbusters” inspired in feel.
One-line concept:
Ever wanted to take that cool cloud native tech on a test-run, but weren’t sure where to start? We’ll test out cloud native technologies and see how they might play into real-world use cases and personal projects.
A show where Kaslin tries out cloud native technologies live: breakages, poor direction following, and all.
What’s an episode like?
A standard show could be taking a sample application or tutorial for a CNCF project and running through it.
Providing a heads up to the project maintainers would likely be a good practice.
The goal will be to evaluate what that exercise teaches about the CNCF project. Ruminate out loud on use cases where that functionality might be useful in more real-world settings. Identify sticking points or gotchas in the tutorial.
This could also be useful feedback for the projects. We may file or help them file bugs on the tutorials/examples.
Talking about how to open bugs or how to connect with the project would be a great thing to share with viewers.
Other show types could include:
Hosting a maintainer/contributor to try out a use case of a feature they’ve been working on.
Longer-form projects which we would spec out in advance, incorporating multiple CNCF projects along the way.
Taking use case ideas from the audience and trying them out on-air. (Probably poorly, but that’s part of the fun.)
