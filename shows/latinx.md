#  Cloud Native LatinX

## Description
Pitch: Cloud Native Latino tells the stories of latinxs that have succeeded in the world of cloud native technology and open source, we talk about their origins and professional trajectory, and focus on being a source of advice and inspiration for all latinxs to realize their potential, rise up in the industry, and support their local communities. Tune in for real world advice on how to advance your career in the world of cloud native, and demonstrate to the world the power and pride of our latin community.

Objectives: Thereâ€™s tremendous talent and potential in Latin America, a region of relatively similar proportions in terms of population to Europe, yet still very much underrepresented in the ecosystem of cloud native and open source technologies. Economic, social and language barriers force talented individuals to flee their country towards achieving their goals. Our objective is to change that. We are working together to demonstrate to the latinx community that it is possible to rise up, that they can produce unique value, and that their vision and culture is important and to be proud of. The new, remote-first reality is also supporting this initiative, as individuals from across the region can join in on events and actively participate in the community as well as opt for professional opportunities without leaving their homes and families behind, also resulting in benefit to their local communities.
