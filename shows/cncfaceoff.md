Bracket/tournament style game show, with CNCF projects “competing”
8 or 16 projects enter and face off against each other in game competition (think a mix of family feud style/trivia challenge) (note that the entries need to be a multiple of 8 because of brackets)
teams probably are four people each (this is 8 people plus host on each stream which is feasible)
if there are 16 projects, in a single elimination style, this means there are 15 competitions
so if we them in the “two faceoffs per episode”, we end up with this:
initial faceoffs - 4 episodes
quarter finals - 2 episodes
semi finals - 1 episode
finals - 1 episode (only episode with a single faceoff) (maybe combine semi-finals and finals into one episode? or maybe make the finals a supersized episode, maybe have the “losers” of the semi finals play against each other for third place) 
so this is 8 episodes, so that’s not bad!
a team could end up being in four episodes (if they get to the championship)
8 projects means 6 episodes
(note that the project names are placeholders for examples)
thinking this through some more - it’s not really feasible to have two faceoffs (total of four teams) per episode, so either we have a really long season (16 episodes)
if we do 8 projects, I think then it’s 7 episodes which is more feasible in general
winning team gets bragging rights, and each team member gets a trophy
each team can be playing for a charity; dollars for the charity donation are accumulated with each round or something? Details TBD. But the winning team will get money donated to the charity of their choice (which they’ve been playing for all along)
it might be waaaay long if you did two teams each episode, because getting through all of them including finals/semi finals would be a lot. So the early episodes would probably be two matchups (team a vs team b, team c vs team d, etc)
style/feel really leaning into game show idea/theme
will create a form for the survey for the game; this will max out at 100 responses. set a time period/deadline.
google doc for suggestions for the questions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yV9Ob2BYBgax8xfmwlT6S6-zp6a9Z7hABxkkZRwHX5w/edit?usp=sharing
will be two forms; total questions we need is 4 per game, and there will likely be 15 games, so 60 questions
