## Description
A livestream series to get more young people involved in the CNCF ecosystem. Here are the talk ideas:

- Get ex-CNCF student mentees / maintainers share their experiences with the projects along with an AMA session.
- Sessions on information related to Open Source programs like Google Summer of Code, Outreachy, LFX, GSoD, etc and also events like KubeCon.
- Session on career development in general: Open Source 101, Networking, Mentorship, etc. with a panel to have a discussion on such things.
- Workshops on essential topics that students may find interesting, like GoLang, System Design, Distributed Systems, Networking, etc.
- Student show and tell, where students who learn from our sessions and make progress can come onto the podcast and share their experiences.

Students will get information regarding the CNCF world and how they can get involved in it. They have this misconception that it's not beginner friendly. There is also lack of awareness about these Open Source programs. They'll also get a chance to ask their questions live and also showcase the work they are doing.
