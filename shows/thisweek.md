# This Week in Cloud Native

## Description
Introspection on latest news, updates, giveaways, and hands-on display of a particular Cloud Native technology. Meant to be a slight variety show which may have different segments as its grows!
People join for the information, a bit of humor, the chance to win swag, meet key figures in the community, learn more about Cloud Native in a crazy welcoming environment. Interactive as questions, comments, and other input from viewers will be worked with live to make the show dynamic.
Serving the viewers! Two way communication always!
Loose chat, easy going attitude, similar to podcast but better.
Live walkthrough, questions answered, major industry highlights discussed, etc..
