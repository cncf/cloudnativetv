**What is CloudNative.tv?**

CloudNative.tv is a twitch livestream show that airs on the CNCF Twitch channel. CloudNative.tv is for the community; and is produced by the community. While it is starting with livestreaming shows on Twitch, it has the vision to become the definitive interactive media experience for anyone wanting to learn, grow, and collaborate with others in the Cloud Native community from anywhere in the world. 

**Who runs CloudNative.tv?**

CloudNative.tv is currently in its bootstrap stage with a number of community members working to get it off the ground. The bootstrap community has selected Kat Cosgrove and David McKay as their co-chairs. Dan Pop is also a co-chair and is the executive producer. He has been hired by CNCF as a contractor for the role. The CloudNative.tv committee/workgroup, made up of all of the show hosts, votes on which new shows to add. You can find more information about the governance on [GitHub](https://github.com/cncf/cloudnativetv/blob/main/governance.md).

**Who is eligible to participate in CloudNative.tv??**

Like every part of our open source community, participation is open to anyone.

**I am a sandbox project. Can I get involved in CloudNative.tv?**

Sandbox projects are not eligible to have their own show on CloudNative.tv focused on the project, however contributors to a sandbox project can be a guest on a show if invited by a show host or they can host a show on a different subject.

***What if I don't have the technical or production skills required to do an ongoing show?***

During the show selection process the co-chairs and members of the group will work with the host to identify any gaps that a potential host may have. If the show is approved, they assist the showrunner with training on how to produce, funding, and other requirements. we will also provide access to streaming software such as Restream Studio or Streamyard to aid in the onboarding.
