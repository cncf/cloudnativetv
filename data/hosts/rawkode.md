David is a Senior Developer Advocate at Equinix Metal, CNCF Ambassador, and a member of the Kubernetes org and release team.

As a professional technology magpie, David was an early adopter of cloud, container, and cloud-native technologies; crossing the murky waters of AWS in 2008, Docker in 2014, and Kubernetes in 2015.

With an insatiable love for technology, David is always on the hunt to learn and share knowledge with others in fun and exciting ways; currently focusing on #RawkodeLive, a live stream for learning the technologies across the cloud native landscape.
