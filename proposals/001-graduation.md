# Graduation Proposal

## Show Proposal Process v1.0

### Introduction 

This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for shows to be accepted for CloudNative TV ("CTV"). The process is the same for both existing shows which seek to move into the CNCF, and new shows to be formed within the CNCF.

### Global Criteria

- Shows must be exclusive to CTV and not stream on other platforms or channels
- Shows must be related to, or benefit, Cloud Native technologies, members, and/or community.

### Considerations

- Number of Viewers
- 

### Project stages

- Sandbox
- Incubating
- Graduated

### Sandbox

All shows that wish to be hosted under CTV at the sandbox level must:

- Stream once every 12 weeks on CTV

Sandbox shows can:

- Stream once every 4 weeks on CTV

Sandbox proposals will be reviewed by CTV for:

- Uniqueness
  - We don't want 4 shows using the same concept
  - Shows streamed in additional languages will be accepted
- Diversity
  - Demographic
  - Language

### Incubation

All shows that wish to be hosted under CTV at the incubation level must:

- Stream once every 4 weeks on CTV

Incubated shows can:

- Stream once every 2 weeks on CTV

### Graduated

All shows that wish to be hosted under CTV at the graduated level must:

- Stream twice every 4 weeks on CTV

Graduated shows can:

- Stream once every week on CTV
