# Voting

In various situations the CloudNative.tv shall hold a vote. These votes can happen on the phone, email, or via a voting service, when appropriate. Members can either respond "agree, yes, +1", "disagree, no, -1", or "abstain". A vote passes with two-thirds vote of votes cast. An abstain vote equals not voting at all.
