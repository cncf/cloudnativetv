## Mission

Consistent with the CNCF SIG definition, the mission of CNCF SIG <T> is to collaborate on strategies related to building, scaling, and
retaining contributor communities, including (people) governance,

sustainable communities with smooth journeys throughout their CNCF project 
lifecycle.

* **Educate and Engage.** Providing stuff to things

## Governance

### Members

Members are active participants in the work of the SIG who are entitled to vote
in any SIG decisions that require a vote.  Any contributor to the SIG is
eligible to become a member after participating in the work of the SIG for at
least three months.

In order to prevent the SIG from becoming unbalanced, it will have the following
limits on who can be a voting member:

Up to one from each participating Incubating or Sandbox CNCF project
Up to two from each Graduated CNCF project
One from each SIG-ContribStrat Working Group, generally the lead for that WG
No more than â…“ of members from the same employer

If a contributor would be entitled to be a member, but are restricted because of
the above limits, they are a non-voting member who may participate in meetings
but cannot vote.

Members who are no longer participating actively in the SIG (including both WG
  work and the regular meetings) will step down from membership.

#### Chairs and TOC Liaison

In accordance with the terms and roles laid out in [cncf-sigs.md](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/sigs/cncf-sigs.md)

The TOC will also appoint 3 [Chairs](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/sigs/cncf-sigs.md#chair)

### Meetings and Decisions

Most SIG work will be carried out without requiring any kind of regular meeting
or vote. The SIG will have a regular meeting, bi-weekly, at which the
membership may vote on the following items as the come up:

* Addition of new members or removal of inactive ones
* Approval of new working groups and retirement of completed/inactive ones
* Approval of reports to be delivered to the TOC
* Approval of formal recommendations to a CNCF project or about that project to
the TOC
* Approval or deprecation of guidelines and documents

### Bootstrapping

Initially, the TOC shall appoint three members in order to launch the SIG
