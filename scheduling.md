# Scheduling

## Registering Your Show

Once you're show has been [approved by the working group](https://github.com/cncf/cloudnativetv/blob/main/operations/SUBMISSION.md) (docs pending), you'll be invited to collaborate on [ClickUp](https://clickup.com).

The first thing you need to do is register your show. There's a list called [Shows](https://share.clickup.com/b/h/6-50857969-2/15964e46bb6e053) (This is the public version). You can add your show to this list and assign it to yourself. See the following video.

## Scheduling

The schedule happens on another list, this one called [Schedule](https://share.clickup.com/c/h/4epg0-8/ae2b516012c6394) (This is the public version). You can add your next episode, or recurring schedule, to this list and link it with your show. See the following video.

### Scheduling a One-Off Episode

View the "Recurring" episode video and do not set up any recurrence.

- Select the date and time for your first episode
- Set a start datetime and end datetime
- Assign to yourself
- Update the status to "Upcoming"
- Associate your show using the relationships section

#### Optional

- Associate subtasks of your episodes to remember to schedule guests
- Add multiple assignees for anyone that's within the system that has also offered to moderate

### Scheduling a Recurring Episode

When you want to reserve a weekly, fortnightly, or monthly slot; you can do as the video shows. Recurring slots will be reviewed by the working group and slots you are unavailable to make should be freed and announced to the working group ASAP. Any missed slots, without notifications, will be reviewed by the working group and your recurring slot may be freed for others.

### Missing a Show

In the case that a Showrunner is unable to hold their show at the scheduled time, they should inform the Leadership Committee (Co-Chairs and CNCF Liason) with as much advance notice as possible so that other shows can be scheduled or assistance can be provided, as needed. If a Showrunner misses 3 or more shows out of the previous 5 scheduled air dates without notice or extenuating circumstances, the committee may remove the show from the schedule and replace it with another program, to ensure schedule continuity for the community.
