Welcome to CloudNative.tv show Offboarding!
This is an issue created to help offboard your show after your show has been retired from CloudNative.tv. 
We would like to complete offboarding within two weeks of acceptance. 

From the show side, please update the following information:
- [ ] Moved to emeritus SIG member and retired show in the README
- [ ] Logo moved to retired in the [branding repo](https://github.com/cncf/cloudnativetv/tree/main/branding)

Things that the CNCF will do:
- [ ] Remove show host from Github repo
- [ ] LastPass Restream permission removed
- [ ] Stream Key permission removed
